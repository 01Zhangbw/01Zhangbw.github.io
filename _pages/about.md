I am a final-year undergraduate student majoring in **Software Engineering** at the [School of Software Engineering](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/sse/), [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/). Now I am a research intern in **CityMind Lab** at [HKUST(GZ)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yuxuan Liang](https://yuxuanliang.com/). Previously, I joined [Machine Learning and Data Mining Lab](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/qianlima/) at [SCUT](https://www.scut.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Qianli Ma](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/qianlima/English/list.htm). And I joined [Key Laboratory of Big Data and Intelligent Robot](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/sse/2018/0615/c16788a270751/page.htm) at [SCUT](https://www.scut.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yi Cai](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=ej3Nb5wAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
