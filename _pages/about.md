I am a final-year undergraduate student (with the highest honor **Top Ten Excellent Students Models of SCUT**) majoring in **Software Engineering** at the [School of Software Engineering](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/sse/), [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/). Now I am doing my research on **Speech Processing**, advised by [Prof. Xiaofen Xing](https://dblp.org/pid/41/9939.html) and [Prof. Qingyao Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n6e_2IgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

Previously, I was grateful to join three research groups as a research intern. To be specific, I was a research intern in [CityMind Lab](https://citymind.top/) at [HKUST(GZ)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yuxuan Liang](https://yuxuanliang.com/). I joined [Machine Learning and Data Mining Lab](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/qianlima/) at [SCUT](https://www.scut.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Qianli Ma](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/qianlima/English/list.htm). And I joined [Key Laboratory of Big Data and Intelligent Robot](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/sse/2018/0615/c16788a270751/page.htm) at [SCUT](https://www.scut.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yi Cai](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=ej3Nb5wAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

My research interests include:

- **Language and Speech Processing**: include *Text-to-Speech, Automatic Speech Recognition, Audio Foundation Model*, et al. 
- **Deep Generative Model**, especially *Large Language Model and Diffusion Model*
- **Data Mining**: *Time-series Modeling, Spatio-temporal Data Mining, Graph Learning*
